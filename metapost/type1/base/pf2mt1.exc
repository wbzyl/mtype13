% THIS FILE BELONGS TO THE METATYPE1 PACKAGE
%
% It is an ``exception file'' for the converter form raw PostScript
% font --> METATYPE1 (METAPOST) font (see pf2mt1.awk)
% AUTHORS: JNS team, JNSteam@gust.org.pl
%
% The data lines (lines that begin with a percent sign
% are comments) have the following form:
%    name1 name2
% where name2 can be empty; if it is empty, the character having name1
% is to be skipped, otherwise it is to be renamed to name2

% can be easily typeset in TeX:
% trademark

% i and j should preferably be constructed (after manual adjustments) using
% dotlessi, originalj, and dotaccent, e.g.:
% i
% j originalj
% if there is no dotlessi in a font, resort to:
% i originali

% It is always advisable to use the following name substitution:
zdot zdotaccent
Zdot Zdotaccent
