\ichingStoreDivination{CH'IEN}{The Origin}
 {The origin. Continuing through. Harmonious. Correct.}
 {Do not use the diving dragon.}
 {The dragon is seen in the field. It is helpful to see the great man.}
 {This wise man is active all day long, but in the evening he is watchful.
  There will be great difficulty.}
 {He is bouncing up and down in stormy waters. The sage says that
  he sometimes leaps up and sometimes down. There is nothing wrong
  in this as long as evil is avoided.}
 {The dragon is flying in the heavens. It is good to see the great man.}
 {A group of headless dragons appears. There will be good fortune.}

\ichingStoreDivination{K'UN}{Success} 
{Great success. A wise man is virtuous and proper, like a strong
  but gentle mare. When he is faced with a task he can only succeed
 if he takes things slowly and carefully, not trying to be first.
 If he is happy to follow others, all will be well. It is
 important to have friends in the south and west, but they can be
 lost or forgotten if they are in the north and east. A wise man
 must remember to draw strength from proper conduct, and by doing
 this he will be fortunate.}
 {He is walking on newly formed frost. Freezing conditions are on
  the way.}
 {Square, straight and strong. Everything will work out well
  without any effort.}
 {He does not reveal his virtue for all to see, but nurtures it
  within himself. He has the opportunity of serving the Emperor
  and will perform his tasks with great success.}
 {A sack has been sealed up so that nothing can flow in or
  out. There will be no blame and no praise. What is done is done.}
 {Imperial yellow undergarments. There will be excellent fortune.}
 {There are dragons involved in a ferocious fight in the desert.
  The blood that flows from their wounds is Imperial yellow.}

\ichingStoreDivination{CHUN}{Birth Pangs} 
 {Birth pangs. He will succeed if he behaves properly. Beware of
  starting a new venture without giving it sufficient thought. It
  will be useful to enlist the help of an experienced person.}
 {The way ahead is blocked. Remain firm. Act sensibly. Listen to
  the advice of someone more experienced.}
 {The horses are outside the village but are not allowed inside.
  The people think they are robbers. They have come to collect the
  bride. The bride remains firm and rejects the union. Ten years
  later she marries and has children.}
 {The hunter, stalking a deer, is drawn into the forest. He failed
  to ask the forester for help and is now lost. The wise man can
  see the dangers which lie ahead. He know it would be foolish to
  continue, so decides to give up the chase.}
 {The woman has lost control of her carriage and the horses are
  running away with her. The man who wants to marry her is nearby
  and she calls for his help. To advance will bring good fortune.
  All will turn out well.}
 {He is finding it difficult to grant the favors people expect of
  him. Wise behavior brings success when dealing with minor
  affairs. Any attempts to deal with major issues will bring
  misfortune.}
 {The man is in complete disarray since his chariot horses have
  gone into full retreat. He cannot hold back his tears and begins
  to weep.}

\ichingStoreDivination{MENG}{Rebellious Youth}
 {Rebellious youth. I do not look for the rebellious and ignorant
  child; it is he who looks for me. When he asks me for an oracle I
  will answer him. But when he asks me a second and third time he
  becomes a nuisance. I refuse to answer his requests. It is
  helpful to be consistent and well behaved.}
 {It is good to use punishment in order to banish ignorance. This
  will free the mind from its bondage. Too much punishment brings
  about humiliation.}
 {Be patient with the ignorant, since this will bring good
  fortune. It is good to listen to the requests of women. A son is
  able to run his family.}
 {Do not become involved with a woman who will easily give herself
  to a man with money. Such behavior will bring misfortune.}
 {It is sordid to be constrained by ignorance. It will bring regret.}
 {The innocent child. There will be good fortune.}
 {Punishing the ignorant child will do no good. It is better to
  protect him.}

\ichingStoreDivination{HSU}{Patience}
 {Patience. Confidence and sincerity will bring prosperity. Virtue
  will encourage good fortune. There is much to be gained by
  crossing the great river.}
 {He is waiting in open country. A lot can be gained by using that
  which endures.}
 {He is waiting on the sand. He will have to tolerate gossip, but
  in the end he will be very fortunate.}
 {He is sitting out in the mud. This allows the enemy to arrive.}
 {He is waiting in a place of blood. He must escape from the pit.}
 {He is waiting amongst the food and drink. Good fortune will come
  through virtue.}
 {He goes into the pit. Three guests arrive who have not been
  invited. Treat them well and in the end there will be good
  fortune.}

\ichingStoreDivination{SUNG}{Contention} 
 {Contention. He is confident in the face of opposition.

  the bitter end there will be misfortune. It is very helpful to
  see the great man. It is not a good idea to cross the great
  river.}
 {He never pursues the issue. He has to tolerate gossip.
  Eventually he will be lucky.}
 {He does not have the strength to face the challenge. If he
  decides to run back home to the three hundred families of his
  city he will bring no harm upon himself.}
 {He stays in the correct place. There are great difficulties at
  the moment but everything will work out well in the end. If he
  should happen to be in the king's service he will not achieve all
  that he hoped for.}
 {He does not have the strength to face up to the challenge. He
  retreats and studies the way fate deals with people. He changes
  his attitude and finds peace in virtuous behavior. There will be
  good fortune.}
 {By attending in the law court extremely good fortune will
  follow.}
 {The leather belt of status may be given to him but it will be
  taken away from him three times in one morning.}

\ichingStoreDivination{SHIH}{The Army} 
 {The army. Everything is correct. Nothing will go wrong is the
  leader is wise and experienced.}
 {The army marches off after receiving its orders. It will be
  disastrous if these orders are wrong or not well thought out.}
 {There is good fortune since the commander is at the center of
  the army. He did not make any mistakes. The king honors him
  three times.}
 {The army has incompetent leaders. There will be misfortune.}
 {The army retreats. There are no mistakes.}
 {There are many different species of birds in the field. Now is
  the time to seize them to avoid mistakes. The eldest son is the
  leader of the army. Although a younger son acts wisely he will
  certainly fail in the role of commander because evil will befall
  him.}
 {The great prince in is complete charge. He chooses men to be
  rulers of countries, and others he appoints as the heads of
  powerful families. He does not give any of these appointments to
  weaker men.}

\ichingStoreDivination{PI}{Unity}
 {Unity. There will be good fortune. When he asks the oracle about
  his fortune he is reassured. Those who are concerned will gather
  together at the right time. Those who arrive late will be
  unlucky.}
 {Confident actions result in unity. Confidence is like an
  overflowing cup which will eventually bring a variety of good
  fortune.}
 {Unity develops from the inner self. Good fortune will result
  from righteous behavior.}
 {He looks to unscrupulous people for unity.}
 {Unity is sought with those outside his close circle. Wise
  behavior will bring good fortune.}
 {The need for unity is becoming obvious. The king hunts the
  wild-fowl on three sides only; he leaves the fourth side open for
  their escape. The local people were not instructed properly.
  There will be good fortune.}
 {There is nobody to lead the united group. It is an evil time.}

\ichingStoreDivination{HSIAO CH'U}{Holding Back the Less Able}

  develop. Clouds approach from our lands to the west but they do
  not bring rain.}

  There will be good fortune.}
 {He is lured back. There will be good fortune.}
 {The spokes in the carriage wheel are broken. The husband and
  wife turn away from each other.}
 {Have confidence. The risk of bloodshed passes and fears
  disappear. There will be no mistakes.}
 {The feeling of confidence is like the security of being bound
  together. He has ample resources close at hand and can draw his
  neighbors to him.}
 {When the rain falls everything stops, but virtue continues to
  flourish. The woman who behaves wisely is still in danger. It is
  nearly full moon. The man who ventures forth at this time will
  cause or create evil.}

\ichingStoreDivination{LI}{Walking Carefully}

  he is not bitten. There is success.}

  do so there will be no problems.}

  hermet will be lucky, if he acts honorably.}

  who treads on the tail of the tiger is bitten and will have bad

  coming back. The man who is steadfast will not be blamed. He is

  finances but turns to his neighbors. He puts his confidence in
  them. He does not withdraw from them.}

  blessing brings great fortune.}

  out badly for the wise man even when he acts correctly. The great
